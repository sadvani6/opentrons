Design with Python

Writing protocols in Python requires some up-front design before seeing your liquid handling automation in action. At a high-level, writing protocols with the Opentrons API looks like:

1) Write a Python protocol
2) Test the code for errors
3) Repeat steps 1 & 2
4) Calibrate labware on robot
5) Run your protocol

These sets of documents aim to help you get the most out of steps 1 & 2, the "design" stage.

********************
Python for Beginners
********************

If Python is new to you, we suggest going through a few simple tutorials to acquire a base understanding to build upon. The following tutorials are a great starting point for working with the Opentrons API (from `learnpython.org <http://www.learnpython.org/>`_):

1) `Hello World <http://www.learnpython.org/en/Hello%2C_World%21>`_
2) `Variables and Types <http://www.learnpython.org/en/Variables_and_Types>`_
3) `Lists <http://www.learnpython.org/en/Lists>`_
4) `Basic Operators <http://www.learnpython.org/en/Basic_Operators>`_
5) `Conditions <http://www.learnpython.org/en/Conditions>`_
6) `Loops <http://www.learnpython.org/en/Loops>`_
7) `Functions <http://www.learnpython.org/en/Functions>`_
8) `Dictionaries <http://www.learnpython.org/en/Dictionaries>`_

After going through the above tutorials, you should have enough of an understanding of Python to work with the Opentrons API and start designing your experiments!
More detailed information on python can always be found at `the python docs <https://docs.python.org/3/index.html>`_

Working with Python
*******************

Currently, we recommend writing your protocols in one of two ways:

Text Editor
===========

Using a popular and free code editor, like `Sublime Text 3`__, is a common method for writing Python protocols. Download onto your computer, and you can now write and save Python scripts.

__ https://www.sublimetext.com/3

.. note::

    Make sure that when saving a protocol file, it ends with the ``.py`` file extension. This will ensure the App and other programs are able to properly read it.

    For example, ``my_protocol_file.py``

Jupyter Notebook
================

For a more interactive environment to write and debug using some of our API tools, we recommend using Jupyter Notebook.

You can access Jupyter Notebook using the following:

1. Open your Opentrons App and look for the IP address of your robot on the robot information page.
2. Type in ``(Your Robot's IP Address):48888`` into any browser on your computer.

Simulating Python Protocols
***************************

As our OT 2 software is no longer bundled with our desktop app, there are a few more steps you have to follow in order
to simulate your protocol without being connected to a robot.

To set up your environment, please view `this support article <https://support.opentrons.com/ot-2/getting-started-software-setup/installing-the-opentrons-api-on-your-computer-for-simulation>`_
